		<h1>My Thumbnails</h1>

	<p>I enjoy making thumbnails for my channel and would love to make yours as well. I can do many styles of thumbnails, so I could most likely do what you are thinking. All you have to do is give me a brief description of what you are looking for. I have a sample thumbnail below</p>
	
	<h3><blockquote>Thumbnail Example</blockquote></h3>

	<img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Example" title="Thumbnail Example" 
	class="photos"/>

		<p>In this thumbnail, I was aiming for a somewhat creepy theme that would draw potential viewers in, hopefully we could achieve the same for yours.</p>

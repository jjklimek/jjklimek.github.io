		<h1>My Banners</h1>

	<p>I also enjoy making various channel banners for my channel. Having a nice channel banner can lead to someone being more likely to subscribe to you. I can do many different formats so that all of your social media accounts are included or I can keep it simple. It is all up to you!</p>
	
	<h3><blockquote>Banner Example</blockquote></h3>

	<img src="banner.jpg" alt="Banner Example" title="Banner Example" 
	class="photos"/>

		<p>In this banner I was aiming to have a neon color theme because that is what I have been liking recently. I think banners are all about showing what you like.</p>
